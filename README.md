# Zowe App Framework - File Transfer Application
## *Short Project Description*

The Zowe Virtual Desktop needs to provide a way to easily transfer files and datasets from the mainframe to a user desktop and vice versa while dealing with encoding and security. The main goal of the project is to work on the file-transfer application and make it ready for the production environment.  It should provide the ability to transfer large files and datasets and also should provide mechanisms to download large files from the client browser. And should work on the back end missing endpoints which requires the file-transfer application to work
